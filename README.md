<h1>Package Delivery Simulation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a workshop in using data structures and algorithms to solve simulated real world problems. The simulation involves a package delivery system using the nearest neighbor algorithm. The only prerequisite for this workshop is knowledge of Python.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The simulation can be run by executing the main.py file. The program will prompt the user for input on the number of packages and the location of each package. The program will then output the optimal delivery route using the nearest neighbor algorithm.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>A detailed walk-through of the project and the algorithms used can be found in the included pdf file.</p>
