Package Delivery Simulation
This repository contains a package delivery simulation using Python and the nearest neighbor algorithm. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of data structures and algorithms in solving simulated real-world problems.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/package-delivery-simulation.git
Running the simulation
To run the simulation, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

Copy code
python main.py
This will execute the simulation using the default settings, which include a grid size of 100x100 and 10 package locations.

Customizing the simulation
You can customize the simulation by modifying the variables in the config.py file. The following variables can be modified:

GRID_SIZE: The size of the grid (default: 100x100)
NUM_PACKAGES: The number of package locations (default: 10)
ALGORITHM: The algorithm used for package delivery (default: "nearest_neighbor")
Viewing results
The simulation results can be visualized using Matplotlib. The simulation will output a graph showing the package delivery route taken by the algorithm.
